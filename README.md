# Out of the Attic Antiques

## About

This page is pretty straightforward.  I simply used a paragraph to provide the background information about the store and then used Google's like for the virtual tour.

## Blog

All the content for this page comes from WordPress.  I utilized the sidebar widget that serves as my search bar and archives posts and categories as well.  When a post is expanded, a scrollable box appears which I was glad I was able to accomplish.  Comments are allowed on the single blog posts as well. 

## Events

The events page was created using the custom post type within WordPress.  All fields on the events archive page are advanced custom fields within WordPress, then styled using CSS.

## Featured Items

The featured items page is generated using the [Photo Gallery by WD](https://wordpress.org/plugins/photo-gallery/) plugin within WordPress.  

## Appraisals

The appraisals page is pretty straight forward.  It uses a JavaScript plugin [Dropzone](http://www.dropzonejs.com/) to allow the user to drag and drop files in the box for upload.

## Contact

The contact page is created using the [Contact Form 7](https://contactform7.com/) WordPress plugin.  The social media icons were inserted using a created partial as well.
