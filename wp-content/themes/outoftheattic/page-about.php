      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Like many antique lovers, owner Glenn Lynch started out as a collector and when the opportunity knocked to open his own store,  he opened the door and never looked back. Now with over 75 dealers, the store is overflowing with everything from turn-of-the-century furniture to 45 records, from itty-bitty glove buttons of the 1930's to 1950's kitsch, from Depression glass to picnic baskets. The list goes on and on.<br><br>
      Glenn's passion for Brewerania began in his basement and soon moved to store shelves, including English water pitchers, shot glasses, beer taps, steins, liquor decanters, whiskey pourers and beer glasses of all shapes and sizes. Julie's collections include tins, vintage buttons and Depression glass.<br><br>
      Contrary to the notion that antique stores are "female and frilly" our store appeals equally to both the male and female collector of all ages, from old trains, stamps, and Star Wars for the boy in every guy and collectible kitchen, china, buttons and vintage accessories for the little girl in every gal. Kids too are happy to tag along with their parents as they shop for kids' books, old restaurant toys, and vintage games.<br><br>
      Make it a family outing! Hope to see you soon.<br><br>
      Best,<br><span>Glenn</span></p> <!--This span is to represent a signature -->
