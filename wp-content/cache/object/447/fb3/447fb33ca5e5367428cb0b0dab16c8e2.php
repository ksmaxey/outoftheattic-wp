We are located in the Northwest corner on the outer drive of Westfield Shoppingtown Fox Valley (formerly the Fox Valley Mall) just west of Toys R Us off Rt. 59 and New York Street.

From I-88, go south on Route 59 to New York Street, turn Right, to Station Blvd, turn Left, to Fox Valley Center Drive, turn Right, go just past Toys R Us and turn right.

From I-55, go north on Route 59 to New York Street, turn Left, to Station Blvd, turn Left, to Fox Valley Center Drive, turn Right, go just past Toys R Us and turn right.

If you are already at the mall, just follow Fox Valley Center Drive around to the Macy's side. We are across the parking lot opposite Macy's northwest entrance.
